The project focuses on developing an examination management system for schools to conduct online examinations. The current version of the software is a web-based application. The examiners can upload various tests in the system and the students can attempt those tests as per schedule given by the examiner. System allows examiner to capture, collate and analyze the data from students and evaluate the impact of the program.

# Mathematical model:
Input: 
1. Let S be the set of student S= {s1, s2, s3,.., sn}

2.	Let Q be the set of questions generated randomly in the exam. Q = {Q1, Q2, Q3,..,Qn}.

3.	T is the set of Teachers/staff of the school.
 
    T= {T1, T2, Tn}.

4.	P is the Principal of the school.


Process:
1.	S will Register and log in at the time of the Exam.
2.	S will select Ss to solve Q. Ss = sections of the paper.
Ss = {Ss1, Ss2, Ss3 Ssn}.
3.	S will select O for each Q.
O is set of selected answer option. O = {O1, O2, O3,,On}.
4.	R of S will be generated after solving Q. R results.
R= {R1, R2, R3,, Rn}.
5.	G will be generated and Display as Per R of S to analyze the IQ of particular S. G is Graph.
G= {G1, G2, G3,.., Gn}.

Output:
X={R,G}
